    "Consumer behavior is a complex phenomenon that is evolving according to the time, situations, demographic characteristics of individuals, personality traits, and cultural influences. The personality of individuals is a unique dynamic organization of the characteristics of a particular person, physical and psychological, which influence behavior and responses to the social and physical environment. It gives the impression that consumer buying is always influenced by their personality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Countless consumers have pondered this question when preparing to buy a new computer. As a result, Apple has been rigorously researching several aspects of consumer buying behavior in regards to the decision making behind this question. Recently, Apple has decided to approach this question from the perspective of the Big Five personality traits and the Hult DNA to identify consumer buying behavior."

We will also separate the Hult DNA questions into 3 groups based on information provided in the Hult Handbook. Using this information we will explore the data and determine if there are any overarching insights prior to diving deeper into the analysis.\n",

It could also be a major driving force for buying decisions and they are more likely to buy a Mac due to familiarity and brand loyalty.</br>\n",
